## Deployment happens:

--> see the _slides_ **[HERE](https://kiwiresearch.netlify.com/#1)**
--> see the _Shiny APP_ **[HERE](https://jedrzejdziedziul.shinyapps.io/Housing/)**

## Description:

This tool has been designed to explore apartements in Milan next to your preferred location and compute a monthly rent price estimation given the spatial coordinates and the expected characteristics of the house, such as: rooms square meters. It is composed by a `Shiny` deployed from a bitbucket repo into [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and a set of `xaringan` slides deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). House data are scraped from [immobiliare](https://www.immobiliare.it/). Full explanation on the slides.


## Visuals:

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE, imgcenter = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("snapshot/screenshot 1.png") 
```

```{r graphics2, echo=FALSE, imgcenter = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("snapshot/screenshot 2.png") 
```

```{r graphics3, echo=FALSE, imgcenter = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("snapshot/screenshot 3.png") 
```

```{r graphics4, echo=FALSE, imgcenter = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("snapshot/screenshot 4.png") 
```

## Dependecies

```{r}
libs = c("rvest", "magrittr", "stringr", "httr",
"furrr", "plotly", "ggplot2", "DT", "readxl", "dplyr")

new.packages = libs[!(libs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
```

## Usage:
the first tab-panel in the tab-set let you explore the available houses on the Milano house market, then once you have find the location of the apartement you right click it. This will assign a marker in `leaflet` object. This marker will be cached in the second tab panel, the *price prediciton calculator*, where you can also specify other characteristics of the desired house. An autoML model will give the estimation in the lower down part on the left.  
In the right drop-down column you can discover other further options to select and the autoML will do its job in parallel. 

## Project status:
this project is still `IN ITINERE`, but it has stopped since my university class is completed.

## Next features:

- implement auto-scraping functions
- choose boostrap .css style 
- better UX

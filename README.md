# Accomodation in Milan is a Mess
## Socio-Economic Circumstances:
- Too much *Demand* wrt to the available *Offer*

- Rent Prices, for the same reason, are **Overshooted**
  
- **Condominium** is a really tough component of the monthly budget and actually It does not make so much sense
  
- Asymmetry of information between you and the agency Advisor
  
- Time factor: you are in a Hurry, houseolds are **Not**

# The questions you come up 
## The most of us:
  
- Where do phisically I have to search?  --> **Immobiliare.it**<sup>[1]</sup>
  
- Where do I need my apt to be? --> **select zone**
  
- Once you have spotted it '(if you made it') you should verify *if it is a good deal*

  
- Are they trying to steal my money? Am I going to pay a fair price?
  
  
- Hey, **I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO TELL ME IF IT IS GOOD OR NOT**, let's find something which is similar to my option, oh I would say a *Comparable*

- Do you know how many are the chances to find a **Comparable** ?


[1] Here it is [immobiliare](https://www.immobiliare.it/), n1 player in online mrkt

# Odds

Now let's try this:
*TRY* to compute the probability to find an apartement given some certain characteristics (even location) equal to someone else with the **SAME** chars

- Randomly select 1 obs from the dataset

- Filter the dataset given the characteristics *(rand selct)* both .red[*Streched*] and .blue[*Strict*]

- Compare the `len` output of the `vec`  wrt to dataset `len`
